            I am a technical professional who has spent the last several years 
            building systems that help organizations understand their data - and 
            actually use it.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          My career has moved through some unexpected territory. I have worked on 
          enterprise systems at SpaceX, built cybersecurity infrastructure, and 
          contributed to policy research and intelligence analysis. Each role 
          taught me something different about how organizations actually function - 
          and fail.
        </p>
        <p>
          The common thread: data. Not data for its own sake, but data as the 
          foundation for clear thinking and decisive action. Most organizations 
          are drowning in information but starving for insight. My work is about 
          bridging that gap.
        </p>

        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          I believe technology should serve people, not the other way around. 
          That dashboards are useless unless someone changes their behavior because 
          of what they see. That the best technical solutions are the ones you 
          barely notice because they just work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also believe in stepping up. When times get hard, when problems seem 
          intractable, when everyone else is pointing fingers - that is when the work 
          matters most. Not for applause. Because it is necessary.
        </p>

        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
          I work at the intersection of data engineering, analytics, and design. 
          That means building pipelines, yes - but also thinking hard about how 
          information gets presented, how decisions get made, and how systems 
          evolve over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I favor solutions that are modular, well-documented, and built to last. 
          Technology moves fast, but good architecture gives you room to adapt.
        </p>

        <h2>Outside Work</h2>
        <p>
          I am interested in design, particularly the kind that communicates 
          clearly without shouting. I read widely - history, science, philosophy. 
          I believe in taking care of the basics: sleep, exercise, time outside.
