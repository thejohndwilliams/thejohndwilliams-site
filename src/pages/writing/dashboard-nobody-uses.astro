  <p>
    There's a particular kind of silence that follows a dashboard demo. The executive 
    nods politely. Someone mentions how "clean" it looks. Then everyone goes back to 
    making decisions the same way they always have—gut instinct, loudest voice in the 
    room, or whatever the CEO saw on their commute.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've watched this happen dozens of times. A team spends months building something 
    technically elegant—real-time data, beautiful visualizations, all the right metrics. 
    Six months later, the dashboard sits unused, a monument to good intentions and 
    misaligned assumptions.
  </p>

  <h2>The problem isn't technical</h2>

  <p>
    Most analytics projects fail for the same reason: they solve problems nobody actually 
    has. The technical architecture is flawless. The data pipeline is robust. The 
    visualizations are gorgeous. But somewhere along the way, someone forgot to ask a 
    basic question: <em>What decision will change because of this?</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    If you can't answer that specifically—"When this metric drops below X, we will do Y"—you 
    don't have an analytics project. You have a data decoration project.
  </p>

  <h2>Start with the decision</h2>

  <p>
    Every successful analytics implementation I've been part of started backwards. Not 
    "what data do we have?" but "what decisions do we need to make, and what would we 
    need to know to make them well?"
  </p>

  <p>
    This sounds obvious. It isn't. Organizations are remarkably bad at articulating 
    their actual decision-making processes. Leaders will tell you they want "better 
    visibility" or "more insights"—vague language that masks a deeper uncertainty 
    about what they're actually trying to accomplish.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The dashboard that gets used is the one that answers a question someone 
      was already asking.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>What to do instead</h2>

  <p>
    Before building anything, spend time with the people who will supposedly use it.
    Not just the executives who requested it—the managers and analysts who will check
    it daily (or won't).
  </p>

  <p>
    Ask them: What decisions do you make regularly? What information do you wish you 
    had? What questions come up in your weekly meetings that nobody can answer?
  </p>

  <p>
    Then build the simplest thing that addresses those specific needs. Not a platform. 
    Not a comprehensive solution. A focused tool that helps real people make real 
    decisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    The best dashboard I ever built had three metrics on it. Three. It replaced a 
    40-tab Excel monster that nobody understood, and it actually got used because it 
    answered exactly the questions that mattered.
  </p>

  <h2>The real work is organizational</h2>

  <p>
    Technical skills are table stakes. The actual challenge is navigating organizational 
    dynamics—understanding who really makes decisions, what they're afraid of, and why 
    they might resist better information even when they claim to want it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because sometimes people don't use dashboards on purpose. They prefer ambiguity. 
    They'd rather have plausible deniability than clear accountability. A dashboard 
    that works is a dashboard that forces choices, and not everyone is ready for that.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your job isn't just to build something that works. It's to build something that 
    works <em>for this organization, with these people, at this moment</em>. That 
    requires understanding people as much as understanding data.
  </p>

  <p>
    The dashboard nobody uses is usually trying to solve a political problem with 
    technology. Don't make that mistake.
